# Distributed Systems and Parallel Computing

Repository for storing experiments about the discipline of Distributed Systems and Parallel Computing in University of Brasilia. It contains the firsts experiments about: basic sockets, RPC, RMI, SOAP and Rest. More information about each of the experiments can be found inside its folders.

Beyond these experiments, the discipline also discussed about OpenMP and MPI but no big experiments (that was worth pushing) were made. One more big experiment were made about Hadoop and Spark but it's not on this repository (later I pushed it on another repository in the form of environment setup tutorial and it can be checked [here](https://github.com/icaropires/hadoop-spark-deep-learning-settings)).
